    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong>

          <li>Hand wash only. Avoid using the dishwasher as it may affect the non-stick coating.</li>
          <li>After use, allow the pan to cool before washing to prevent thermal shock.</li>
          <li>Use a soft sponge or cloth with mild dish soap. Avoid abrasive cleaners and scouring pads.</li>

          <li>Store the pan in a dry place to prevent rust.</li>
          <li>If stacking with other cookware, place a soft cloth or paper towel between them to protect the surface.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Safety Tips</h3>

      <li><strong>Handle Care:</strong> The steel handle may get hot during cooking, so always use oven mitts or a handle cover.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid High Heat:</strong> Prolonged exposure to high heat can damage the non-stick coating and the pan's overall durability.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Wooden or Silicone Utensils:</strong> To preserve the non-stick surface, avoid using metal utensils that can scratch the coating.</li>
